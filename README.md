A Hacking Software made with love by Thinking Minds 

# NOTE
This software is still under development and not ready yet, so don't expect much.

# Story
This software is a hacking software being made by Thinking Minds. It's not going to be big and it might not work equally on all platforms, so don't expect much.
Any ideas and feedbacks are welcome through my Whatsapp/call: +263771657582

# Purpose
The main purpose is to flexibly allow the so called hackers or anyone to actually pentest their network,
devices for vulns and seek prior solutions. This expected to be done by reducing the need of having to run
commands in the terminal but only do what you need to do by only a push of a button.

# Why Open-Source?
The idea is to allow people learn the development of software using QT through contributing to this software. QT is difficult to learn but its best for Software Development
and if most of us choose it, imagine how great our world will be if we are all finally developing with memory efficiency in mind.
